<h1>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways</h1>
<p>At the start of this semester, I knew absolutely nothing about programming! Sometimes I still feel that way.. until it's time to work on the Labs or WODs and I kinda surprise myself by knowing how to work stuff out on my own. Then I'm like.. okay maybe I know a little something. Before, I would rely greatly on screencasts and having to RTFM every little thing, but now I feel more confident in myself and what I know to help get me to the other side of the tunnel without having to use those as my first solution.</p>
<h1>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills</h1>
<p>I think asking for help is my biggest weakness.. I don't ask for enough help and I feel like that greatly impacts my improvement. However, for assignment 1, I threw up my white flag and asked for help from my fellow classmates and the TA's. MAN, I just wish I had done that much sooner because it was so beneficial for my understanding. Asking for help sooner definitely could have saved me a lot of time...and tears. I also still have a bone to pick with loops, I will be seeing her outside.</p>
<h1>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast</h1>
<p>I do agree that I have learned a lot from the WODs! They were actually more enjoyable for me to do than the labs. For assignment 1, I noticed that some of the tasks we went over already in the WODs, so I was able to apply some of that knowledge to that. In the beginning of the semester, I would watch the screencasts first, but I understand now how that wasn't helpful for my learning at all because while I was doing it, I wasn't taking in any of the information. However, throughout the semester I would test myself and do it without watching the screencasts and only refer to them for reassurance to check that  what I was doing was correct. This prepared me for the last few WODs where we had no screencasts!</p>
<h1>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence</h1>
<p>I do agree that the labs have helped me learn, I just dread that they are so long and kinda time consuming. However, I do feel that I am able to help them confidence. I do like that they sometimes recall things that we have done in previous labs so we're always using what we learned and not just having that knowledge sit for so long before we have to use it again.</p>
<h1>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2</h1>
<p>I do think I have learned a lot from my assignment 1 experience. Everything was really trial and error at first. As I mentioned before, working with my other classmates and the TA's, I was able to get different perspectives and learn a lot from them along the way. While I am weary of assignment 2, I do feel that I am a bit more prepared for this one compared to assignment 1.</p>
<h1>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways</h1>
<p> I think having more workshop days like how we did for assignment 1 would be helpful. Days where we can really just focus and get into the nitty gritty of some of the issues majority of the students have. While I enjoy listening to Professor talk, he does tend to ramble a bit and I get a bit lost in it. I do appreciate that he reels himself in however so we can get back on track.</p>
<h1>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.)</h1>
<p>I think our screencasts & working with other classmates are what help me the most. The screencasts help me recall on some of the stuff we have learned. It is a good memory refresher. Working with other classmates also helps greatly, because I'm able to get peers opinions and get an understanding of where we all are. I also enjoy that we are able to teach eachother things that one of us may have not already known! Good stuff!</p>
