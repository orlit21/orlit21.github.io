<h1>Preparing for WODs</h1>
<p>Invoice1 is a WOD using JS expressions to generate a sales reciept. You can learn more about this WOD <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">here</a></p>
<p> I didn't think this WOD was too bad! I did what I had been doing for the previous WODs; doing them over and over again until I felt confident enough to record and narrate it. However, when I got to the step that required us to generate the product rows, THAT threw me for a loop. At first, I had tried to use option 2, which was to add an id to the table and remove the product row template. I could not figure out what I was doing wrong! When I had went to input the second item row, instead of being placed in the table row, It was placed on the side of the table. I had attempted it at least 5 times till I realized that I should just use the document write option, and that worked out just fine for me...after I watched the screencast. </p>
<p> I don't think I did anything too different for this WOD compared to the others. Instead of doing a screencast first and then narrating it, I did them both at the same time. It saved much more time!  </p>
