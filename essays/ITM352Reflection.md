<h1>Reflecting on my ITM352 Experience</h1>
<h2>1. ITM352 Course Goals</h2>
<h4>1.1 Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context</h4>
<p>I believe I acquired basic programming skills throughout the entirety of ITM352. I've acquired some skills by learning how to use a programming language like JavaScript. We used JavaScript <i>heavily</i> throughout the course to aid us in things like web development. I enjoyed learning about the fundementals of web development like how to structure the content and style a web page through HTML forms and CSS. I did not have any programming skills prior to taking this course, but after this semester I feel a bit more confident in my programming abilities and feel I could apply the skills i've inherited to future courses or for my own IT needs.</p>
<h4>1.2 Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge</h4>
<p>Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge is to understand how very crucial these skills are for things like conveniency, and efficiency in your job. Working on the SmartPhone Products w/ Varaibles WOD, showed me how to eliminate hard-coding and use variables to achieve the same goal. This WOD was one strategy among many of showing me how I can do the same exact task in an easier, time efficient way. Knowledge in basic programming could aid an MIS person while working on things like data management, troubleshooting, and security, and overall make their jobs a bit easier. </p>
<h4>1.3 Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications</h4>
<p>Assignment 1 was the most difficult hands-on experience in developing software applications I had. Professor Port had provided us with a template to get started with assignment 1, which at first, I thought was super helpful until I realized how heavily I had to modify it to fit the requirements. I overthought a lot of things, and was even letting the assignment get the best of me at some points. I think validating a purchase based on the 3 given requirements was what I had struggled with the most. Despite this project being so difficult, I recieved a 4.2 out of 4, which was such a shock to me because I was not too confident in what I had turned in, but I prevailed. </p>
<h4>1.4 Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions</h4>
<p>One MIS problem I had experienced first-hand was figuring out how to enhance the user experience on assignments 1 and 2. The template we were given to start off assignment 1, I thought it was good at first, and from there I wasn't entirely sure what really needed to be fixed or changed. I had the same dilemma during assignment 2. However, after chipping away and working at it for so long, I began to realize how much actually needed to be changed to better cater to the user (ie data validation, good UI), and how awful the template was. This taught me a lesson of actually taking the time to understand a problem even though it may not present itself, which happens A LOT in programming. I've also learned that <i>PATIENCE</i> is the solution to many MIS problems. </p>
<h4>1.5 Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues</h4>
<p>We experienced understanding first-hand project management and software development issues through working on the assignments. Both assignments required us to effectively complete several tasks and address any problems we may have ran into along the way. I did not get to work in a team this semester, but I did have many of my classmates to lean on in times of need which I am grateful for. However, I do wonder if working in teams was a requirement this semester, how that would have aided or hindered this experience. </p>
<h4>1.6 Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems</h4>
<p>I do think I have much more confidence to gain when it comes to addressing MIS problems. However, I won't discredit myself because I've only just started my MIS journey. I think assignment 2 was a big step at gaining my confidence because instead of running to ChatGPT or the TA's for help, I would attempt to figure the issues I encountered on my own, first. That was a surprise to me, because I would have never thought I would be able to understand and fix problems in programming without having to use help from a 2nd or 3rd party. There is much more room for improvement I'm sure!  </p>
