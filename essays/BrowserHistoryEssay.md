<h1>Browser History 1</h1>
<p>This WOD taught me how to develop a simple web page using HTML.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this WOD was not the hardest for me. My strategy was to do it as many times as I could until I felt comfortable and the process was finally embedded in my brain. This WOD took me about 4 trys until I finally got it. I would be in the middle of a screencast and forget how to execute a certain step and I would have to stop it the recording, delete the file, and start all over again. Finally, on the 4th attempt, I finished it in about 13 minutes! The hardest part of this WOD for me had to be editing my voice over into the screencast and uploading it to YouTube. Definitely went into DNF time in terms of uploading it. Ha!</p>
<h1>Browser History 2</h1>
<p>This WOD taught me how to develop a web page using basic CSS and Google Web Fonts.</p>
<p>Out of the 3, I found this WOD to be the easiest! I used the same strategy. I practiced over and over and over...again. However, there was one small thing that threw me for a loop and that was linking the specific fonts I needed for my webpage (which I didn't figure out until I had watched the screencast!) After I had figured out the issue (and 4 attempts later), I was finally able to finish it in about 7 minutes! The upload process for this one was much easier since I had just decided to create a google drive folder and link that instead of creating an entire YouTube video.</p>
<h1>Browser History 3</h1>
<p>This WOD taught me how to develop a web page using Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<p>Three letters. DNF. Literally DNF 6 times, my friends ;( . At first, I had so much trouble just trying to start the server! It took me about an hour trying to figure out why it would not start, until I finally realized it was because I had accidentally copied and pasted the entirety of the BrowserHistory2 directory into the BrowserHistory3 directory so it was throwing everything off! Alas, I fixed it and everything is good right? WRONG. The WOD itself was definitely a doozy as it took me from 4pm until 9pm to even get a grasp on what I was supposed to be doing. I'll let you guess how many times I watched the screencast. This WOD took me 8 tries! (I have so many screencasts on my desktop now from all my attempts!) Even though it had me in the first half..I still prospered. On my last attempt, I got it done in about 8 minutes! No WOD stopped this train!</p>
